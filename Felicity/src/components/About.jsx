          My name is <span className="text-dark-pink-2 font-semibold">Felicity Mncube</span>, and I'm currently
          a student at Melsoft Academy pursuing a qualification in Software Engineering. I have a
          deep passion for technology and innovation, and through code I'm able to create meaningful
          experiences, solving real world problems, and making a positive impact to the world. I'm really looking 
          forward to being a Full-stack developer one day.

          I completed my matric in 2023, and the following year, I decided to
          explore the world of programming. I started by learning the basics of web development,
          and just building simple projects, and since then I've been growing from there.
